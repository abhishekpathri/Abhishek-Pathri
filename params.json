Teetotaler.","body":"![At New York, Summer 2015](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203943316578133)\r\n### Brief Intro\r\nI love to [entertain](https://www.youtube.com/user/abhi509), it makes me happy to be the reason for someones smile. Well known for my [Parody Songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEU9229JZE4) and [Lyrical ventures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xikpwpy1s_8). I stay humbled by the love, affection and encouragement of my well wishers.\r\nI have been a performer since my school days in Sri Sathya Sai Primary School, enacting dramas, playing for school band and doing my own creative mischief. Fun never ends.  \r\n\r\n### My Hobbies\r\nBeing a big fan of music and AR Rahman sir I have always wanted to learn as many musical instruments as possible and I am learning everyday. I can play the Bansuri Flute, Keyboard, Alto, Recorder, Violin, Harmonica, Dholak and Kanjeera.\r\n\r\n### Education (because it is a must for everyone)\r\nI have a dream/long term goal to set up an organization to educate the deprived and poor children with practical knowledge and related theory. I have earned a B.Tech Mechanical Engineering degree from K L University (2009-13) and I am currently pursuing my Masters in Mechanical Engineering at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.\r\n\r\n### Contact \r\nI promptly respond to [Gmail](abhi.fun4ever@gmail.com) and messages on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/abhishek.pathri).
